# seller_clean (Core Java & Servlets implementation)
*year 2013*

This is a branch of ["seller"](https://github.com/Fotonix/seller) project. Here I tried to create a fully functional web-application without using additional frameworks.
It based on Core Java and Servlets/JSP only.

Technology stack:
- Java 1.6
- Servlets 3.0
- JSP
- JDBC
- Maven
